# DATA301_FinalProject_SuperBowlPredictionModel

## Purpose of each file: 

### 1) *data_collection_&_cleaning.py: 
#### The purpose of this file is to create the 'football.csv' file included in this repository. This file is created through a series of webscraping and data cleaning. 
##### *This file takes a long time to run due to the amount of data being scrapped and cleaned. 

### 2) data_exploration.py:
#### The purpose of this file is to create visualizations to start to determine which NFL stats have an influence on whether or not a team wins the Super Bowl.

### 3) machine_learning.py: 
#### The purpose of this file is to determine the best data model (ie combination of variables) to predict Super Bowl winners. The best model is selected based on the best f1 and k value. 

## Conclusion: 

### Our model was reasonably accurate based on the fact that for every season from 2002 to 2021 the model had the actual Super Bowl winner in its prediction of potential winners. 

### The goal of our project was to determine who would win the Super Bowl in the 2022 season. The conclusion of our initial project was that based on the 2022 NFL season as of December 2022, abd the predicted winner of the Super Bowl at the time would be the San Francisco 49ers or the Buffalo Bills. In retrospect, we now know the winner of the 2022 Super Bowl was the Kansas City Chiefs. To further test our model, the model was ran again after the 2022 NFL season was completed (now that all the season's stats are finalized) to see if the model was capable in predicting the correct winner.
